# Animated Menu

This project implements an animated menu using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The menu is designed to be responsive and interactive, with animations handled using CSS transitions and transformations. Special care has been taken to use SCSS features like loops for styling instead of relying on JavaScript for styling.

## SCSS Styling

The styles for this project are written in SCSS. Key features include:

-   **Variables**: Variables are used for colors and other reusable values.
-   **Nesting**: SCSS nesting is used to reflect the HTML structure.
-   **Loops**: SCSS loops are used to apply styles to multiple elements efficiently.
- 
## JavaScript

The JavaScript in this project is documented using JSDoc for better readability and maintainability. The main functionality includes toggling the menu and handling click events for menu items using `event delegation pattern`.
